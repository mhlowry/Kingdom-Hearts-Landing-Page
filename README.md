# Landing Page Project
 A simple landing page to practice HTML and CSS. The focus of this project is utilizing flexbox.

 This is a project in The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com) where I am recreating a page via a provided screenshot. I do not take credit for the design of the page as it is a recreation.
